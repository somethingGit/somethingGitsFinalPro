# Reflection
    
## Jason
### Does the game have everything in the needs to have list?
    Sadly it does not. I wish it did but I ran out of time and should have not done such a complex task.
### Were there any problems I could not solve?
    I was unable to solve block breaking, perfecting Gravity and Collision, the Inventory, and fov changes. 
## What was hardest thing about this project? 
    The hardest thing personally about this project was having a 2d GUI in a 3d world. 
### What do I regret? 
    I regret trying to do such a large project. I though that I would have enough time to figure out all of the flaws but clearly, that did not happen.
